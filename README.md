# RAG-Chatbot-LangChain
 A repository for building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using LangChain. It involves loading a dataset as the knowledge base, setting up a RAG pipeline, and implementing a chatbot that retrieves relevant data and generates accurate responses to user queries.
RAG Chatbot Implementation with LangChain.


Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using LangChain. The chatbot loads a custom dataset as a knowledge base, retrieves relevant information, and generates accurate responses to user queries.

Features

Loads and processes datasets in formats like CSV, JSON, or documents.
Implements a RAG pipeline using LangChain’s tools, including LLMChain.
Enables accurate retrieval-based question answering from the knowledge base.
Interactive chatbot functionality for user queries.
Tasks Performed
Task 1: Data Loading
Loaded a dataset in [CSV/JSON/Other Document Format].
Preprocessed the data to ensure compatibility with the RAG pipeline.
Task 2: RAG Setup with LangChain
Configured LangChain’s tools for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
I used components like LLMChain to integrate retrieval and response generation.
Task 3: Build the Chatbot
Built a chatbot leveraging the RAG pipeline to answer user questions accurately.
Integrated a retrieval mechanism for querying the loaded knowledge base.
